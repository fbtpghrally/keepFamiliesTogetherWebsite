                      <h2>The Pittsburgh rally for <strong>Families Belong Together</strong>, is an action to show support for immigrant families and a humane immigration policy.</h2>
                      
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 2em">
                      We believe that the current treatment of immigrant families seeking asylum is cruel and inhumane, and we demand that our elected leaders make changes that respect the rights of individuals and families. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We believe that all people, regardless of national origin, deserve respect and kindness. We believe that the United States stands for justice. We believe that laws should protect and not harm. We believe that our elected leaders should represent the beliefs and will of the people they represent. We believe that public action is required to make our voices heard on behalf of those who cannot speak. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We encourage Pittsburghers to join us on June 30 to make clear that the current treatment of immigrant families is unacceptable. We plan for a peaceful, family-friendly event that brings together the community in support of a humane approach to immigration. 
                      </p>

                    <button class="accordion">When is it?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p style="text-indent: 0;text-align: center!important;">Saturday, June 30, 2018, 12pm</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Where is it?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					    <div>Mellon Square</div>
						<div>210 Forbes Ave</div>
						<div>Pittsburgh, PA 15222</div>
						<p></p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">How should I get there?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>There will be carpool meeting spots around the city and suburbs. Public transit will take you right downtown. If you drive, plenty of downtown parking spots and garages will be open. If you bike, be prepared to lock your bike.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Will it be accessible?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>The event is planned for the sidewalk and open space in the square, so should be as accessible as most downtown sidewalks. We’ll have accessibility monitors available to help as needed. We’ll also have chairs available for those who can’t stand the whole time. If you’d like a sign-language interpreter, please let us know in advance so we can arrange one.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Can I bring my kids?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes! This is a peaceful, family-friendly rally in support of immigrant families and humane immigration policies. </p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Can I bring my dog?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes! It’s outdoors, so as long as your dog is calm in crowds and on a leash, said dog is welcome.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Can I bring signs?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Yes! We’re planning a sign-making party for the day before. Your signs should be family-friendly and supportive of the event’s goals. </p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Will there be restrooms available?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>We will have portable restrooms on site, including wheelchair-accessible facilities.
</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Will there be water or food available?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>We will have water available for those who need it. Some businesses in the area may be open to purchase from. </p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">Isn’t this all over? Why are we still doing this?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>The Executive Order does not address the current adults and children detained separately, it does not provide for decriminalization of border crossing, it does not include a plan for reunification of families, and it does not get people out of cages. It is political theater that will be challenged in court.</p><p> The underlying issues of the rights of immigrants, children, and families are still at stake and require our attention.</p>
